    <h1>November 9, 2015 </h1>
You left so unexpectedly. I wasn’t ready for it. Dad wasn’t ready for it. No one was. What I thought was going to be any normal day changed my life forever. I took your time in this world for granted and I regret not expressing enough how much I cared about you. It sucks because on your birthday that year, I made it a goal of mine to communicate with you more. I wrote messages and left them in your lunchbox so that you could come across it while you were at work. I hope those messages are still with you wherever you are. 
<br>
<br>
You made sure that there was always something to eat. There was never a time where I would go to the kitchen feeling hungry and leaving the same way. When there comes a time I start my own family, I will carry on the duties of a parent like how you did. Thank you for teaching me that.  
<br>
<br>
That day I came home from school, you made mi xao, a Vietnamese stir fried egg noodle dish. Dad told me you left the house to get more ingredients from Thang Long. As I sat there at the dining table eating mi xao, I couldn’t enjoy it. I could only think of it being the last meal I would ever eat from you… and so I didn’t finish my bowl. I’ve made it a goal of mine to learn how to cook mi xao. I hope it’ll be up to par with yours.   
<br>
<br>
One of the few pictures that I have of us together. We were at the doctor’s office and I took a picture of us while we were waiting. You said that your nose looked big in this photo and I’ll forever cherish that memory. Your passing helped me understand what it means to be present in the moment when I’m with someone. 
<br>
<br>
Although you’re no longer physically present, I still see the signs that you’re around. There was a time when I revisited the apartment we lived in. The bedroom window was left open and there were hundreds of ladybugs gathered on the ceiling. As I was standing there marveling at the ladybugs, one of them bit me ha-ha. Fast forward some time and I’m dealt with the task of painting Vy’s front door. While painting, there just happened to be a ladybug on the door and so every time I see a ladybug, I connect it with you being next to me.  
<br>
<br>
There are a lot goals that I wasn’t able to accomplish while you were alive. There were so many events that I thought you would be there to witness. I had envisioned you being every step of the way through my life events like when I get married, or when I become a parent, or when I get my first car, my first house, when I start my career… I wish you were able to see the growth and maturity within me throughout these years. 
<br>
<br>
It saddens me that I wasn’t able to be strong for you when it came time to justice. It’s something that I will have to carry on and live with and learn from and I’m sorry. I’m doing my best to make up for it. 
<br>
<br>
Life without you has given me a new perspective on life. It’s taught me that life can change in an instant and that tomorrow isn’t promised. So while I’m still alive, I should do the things that make me happy and strive to be a better person than who I was yesterday. It’s taught me to appreciate the time I have while I still can and not take the moments I have with people for granted. It’s taught me that when you’re gone, you will be remembered by the memories you left them and how you made them feel. 
<br>
<br>
Your hard work allowed us to have food on our plate, clothes on our back, and a roof over our head. My strong work ethic derived from seeing you get up early, coming home late AND still have the energy to cook for us. At the age of 64, you only had a couple more years until you could retire. Although retirement came earlier than expected, I believed you would have continued to work past 65. You deserve to rest with everything that you’ve done for us. May you rest in peace and continue to watch over Dad, myself, and everyone else. Everything I set to accomplish will be in honor of you. Your sacrifices will not be forgotten and I will continue to live each day to the fullest. This one is for you.
<br>
<br>
To everyone that came out to my mom’s funeral to give respect and those who sent flowers, thank you… And to those who came over to visit me the night it happened, it meant a lot to me that you went out of your way to stop by and just be there…
<br>
<br>
I miss: <ul>
    <li>the echoing of your voice downstairs when you called out my name</li>
    <li>the laughter you and Dad shared and the smiles that came with it</li>
    <li>the sound of your alarm clock going off at six in the morning</li>
    <li>the sight of you brushing your hair in front of the mirror </li>
    <li>the sound of the front door closing when you left for work</li>
    <li>waiting in the car with Dad to pick you up from work</li>	
    <li>the bucket hats you wore out in public (I was slightly embarrassed ha-ha but looking back, that was part of your style and I wish I got us matching hats)</li>
    <li>having to go find you when your friends came to visit </li>
    <li>taking you to go visit the doctor’s</li>
    <li>your home cooked meals</li>
    <li>you nagging at me to go to church</li>
    <li>walking home from church through the alley together</li>
    <li>the sight of you strolling through the backyard to water your garden during those hot summer days</li>
    </ul>
